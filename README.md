# Hivemind

## Description

[UHP](https://github.com/jonthysell/Mzinga/wiki/UniversalHiveProtocol)-compliant [Hive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hive_(game)) game engine in Python.

Currently, it's a WIP. Future plans include designing an AI to play the game.

The game engine logic is - sometimes loosely, sometimes strongly - inspired from [Mzinga Engine](https://github.com/jonthysell/Mzinga).

## Documentation

The source code is fully documented with Docstrings in [reST](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html).  
The structured documentation can be generated with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), and will be included directly in the repository in the future.
